GitPod was used to write all code in this repository and pushed via Git to GitHub.

### Local Installation

#### 1. Cloning the project

- The code can be run locally through clone or download from the repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Aramantos/MS4-ShakesOnTheBeach).
- You can do this by opening the repository, clicking on the Code' button and selecting either 'clone or download'.

![Image](static/cloning.png)
- The Clone option provides a URL, which you can use on your CLI with `git clone <paste url>`.
- The Download ZIP option provides a link to download a ZIP file that can be unzipped on your local machine. The files can then be uploaded to your IDE.

Apart from that, you also need to create accounts with the following services:
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-ie)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) to set up the [S3 basket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html)
- [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/)

#### 2. Create Environmental Variables

- Create an env.py file, in this file enter the Environmental Variables (**replace the values with your own**) as follows:

```python
        import os

        os.environ.setdefault("IP", "IP_ADDRESS")
        os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "PORT")
        os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "DATABASE_URL"
        os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "SECRET_KEY"
        os.environ["STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"
        os.environ["STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"] = "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"
        os.environ["STRIPE_WH_SECRET"] = "STRIPE_WH_SECRET"
```

Read more about how to set up the Stripe keys in the [Stripe Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/keys)

#### 3. Create a .gitignore file

- Create a file called **.gitignore** in the root directory and ensure it contains the following git exclusions:

```text
    core.mongo*
    core.python*
    env.py
    .env
    __pycache__/
    *.py[cod]
    node_modules/
    .github/
    *sqlite3
    *.pyc
```

#### 4. Install project dependencies

- Install project requirements by typing `pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### 5. Heroku Deployment
   
To deploy the project to [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) the following steps need to be completed:    

Steps 1-3 are already done in this project and included in the GitHub repository but illustrated here as they are required for the successful deployment to Heroku.

1. Make sure the **requirement.txt** file, which contains a list of the dependencies is present, use the following command to create one

    `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`    

2. Create a **Procfile**, in order to tell Heroku how to run the project, using the following command in the terminal:    

    `web: gunicorn art_of_tea.wsgi:application`    

3. `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` these files to GitHub repository.

4. On the [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) website you need to create a **new app**, assign a name (must be unique), set a region to the closest to you(for my project I set Europe) and click **Create app**.   

5. Go to **Resources** tab in Heroku, then in the **Add-ons** search bar look for **Heroku Postgres**(you can type `postgres`), select **Hobby Dev — Free** and click **Provision** button to add it to your project.  

6. In Heroku **Settings** click on **Reveal Config Vars**.   

7. Set the following config variables there:      

| KEY            | VALUE         |
|----------------|---------------|
| IP | `<IP_ADDRESS>`  |
| PORT | `<PORT>`  |
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | `<your AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>`  |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | `<your AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>`  |
| DATABASE_URL | `<your postgres DATABASE_URL>`  |
| EMAIL_HOST_PASS | `<your email app password(generated by Gmail)>` |
| EMAIL_HOST_USER| `<your email address>`  |
| SECRET_KEY | `<your SECRET_KEY>`  |
| STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | `<your STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY>`  |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | `<your STRIPE_SECRET_KEY>`  |
| STRIPE_WH_SECRET | `<your STRIPE_WH_SECRET>`  |
| USE_AWS | `True`  |
     
8. Copy **DATABASE_URL** (Postgres database URL) from the Config Vars and temporary paste it into the default database in **settings.py**.   

    You can temporarily comment out the current database settings code and just paste the following in the settings.py:   
```bash 
DATABASES = {     
        'default': dj_database_url.parse("<your Postrgres database URL here>")     
    }
```
**Important Note:** that's just a temporary set-up, this URL **should not be committed and published to GitHub** for security reasons, so make sure not to commit your changes to Git while the URL is in the settings.py.  

9. Migrate the database models to the Postgres database using the following commands in the terminal:    
`python3 manage.py makemigrations`     
`python3 manage.py migrate`     

10. Load the data fixtures(**categories**, **products**, **itinerary**, **itinerary_items**, **events**) into the  Postgres database using the following command:     

    `python3 manage.py loaddata <fixture_name>`  

11. Create a **superuser** for the Postgres database by running the following command(*you need to follow the instructions and inserting username, email and password*):      

    `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`     
12. You need to remove your Postgres URL database from the settings and uncomment the default DATABASE settings code in the settings.py file. 
   
    **Note:** for production, you get the environment variable 'DATABASE_URL' from the Heroku Config Vars and use Postgress database, while for development you use SQLite as a default database.     

13. Add your Heroku app URL to **ALLOWED_HOSTS** in the settings.py file.

14. You can connect Heroku to GitHub to automatically deploy each time you push to GitHub.    
To do so, from the Heroku dashboard follow the steps:
    -  **Deploy** section -> **Deployment method** -> select **GitHub**
    - Link the Heroku app to your GitHub repository for this project
    - Click **Enable Automatic Deploys** in the Automatic Deployment section
    - Run the `git push` command in the terminal, which would now push your code to both Github and Heroku, and perform the deployment.     

    Alternatively, in the terminal you can run:    
    - `heroku login`    
    -  after adding and committing to Git, run the following command:     
    `git push heroku master`

15. After successful deployment, you can view your app by clicking **Open App** on the Heroku platform.

16. You will also need to verify your email address, so you need to login with your superuser credentials and verify your email address in the admin panel. Now you will be able to view the app running!   

#### Hosting media files with AWS
The **static files** and **media files** (that will be uploaded by superuser - product/service images) are hosted in the [AWS S3 Bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/). To host them, you need to create an account in AWS and create your S3 basket with *public access*. More about setting it up you can read in [Amazon S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html) and [this tutorial](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html).

#### Sending email via Gmail
In order to send real emails from the application, you need to connect it to your **Gmail account**, setting up your **email address** in the EMAIL_HOST_USER variable and your **app password** generated by your email provider in EMAIL_HOST_PASS variable.

#### 6. Deploy locally

- To run the project locally, in the terminal type `python3 manage.py runserver`
- This will open a localhost address, which is provided in the CLI.
